## Binary Trees

A binary tree is made of nodes, where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference, and a data element. The topmost node in the tree is called the root.

Binary trees are used to represent a nonlinear data structure. There are various forms of Binary trees. Binary trees play a vital role in a software application. One of the most important applications of the Binary tree is in the searching algorithm.

Big(O):
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(n)
